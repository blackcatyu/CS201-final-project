# CS201-final-project
This is the final project for COMPSCI 201 (24 Fall). The project involves building a Java application to process and manage a database file (people.txt) containing personal information using a variety of data structures and algorithms.
## 🏆 Project Overview
This project implements a system for processing a structured database file containing personal information. The system includes:

✔️ A Binary Search Tree (BST) for storing and searching records

✔️ A Heap for sorting and organizing records

✔️ A HashMap with quadratic probing for efficient data retrieval

✔️ A utility class to handle file loading, searching, and sorting
## 🚀 Features
✅ BST (MyBST)

- getInfo() – Returns total number of nodes and the tree height

- insert() – Inserts a new record into the tree

- search() – Finds records by first and last name

✅ Heap (MyHeap)

- insert() – Adds a record into the heap

- remove() – Removes a record from the heap

✅ HashMap (MyHashmap)

- put() – Adds a record to the map

- get() – Retrieves a record by key

- delete() – Removes a record from the map

- Quadratic probing used for collision handling

✅ Database Processing (DatabaseProcessing)

- loadData() – Loads data from file into BST

- search() – Searches for records in BST

- sort() – Sorts records using heap sort

- getMostFrequentWords() – Finds the most frequent words in the database
## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load data from (people.txt) into the BST

2. Search records using BST

3. Sort records using heap
4. Find the most frequently appearing words using HashMap
## ✅ Completed Tasks

✅ All core methods implemented

✅ Data loading, searching, and sorting tested

✅ Frequency analysis using HashMap

✅ Code well-organized and documented
## 🏅 Future Improvements

🔹 Add support for different record types

🔹 Expand search and sorting criteria (e.g., by birthday)

🔹 Improve tree and heap visualization
